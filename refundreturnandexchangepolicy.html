Refund, Return & Exchange Policy<br>
We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If you are not, we are here to help. Please review our policy on returns, refunds, and exchanges.

Returns<br>
We accept returns of unused and undamaged items within 30 days of the delivery date. To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, with all original tags and packaging intact.

To initiate a return, you must contact our customer service team at refunds@greedylearning.com or through our website’s return portal. We will provide you with a return merchandise authorization (RMA) number and instructions on how to send back your item.

You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable.

Refunds
Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email notification. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.

If your return is approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment within 7–10 business days. Please note that it may take some time for your bank or credit card company to post the refund.

Refunds will not be issued for items that are:

Damaged due to misuse or neglect.

Not in their original condition or are missing parts.

Returned more than 30 days after delivery.

Exchanges
You can request for exchange within 2 days of delivery. The exchanged or replaced product will be delivered within 10 days.
