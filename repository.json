javascript-> async : http request is linear and page can wait for its request while loading things on its end. 
			api might take sometime but the API is not having its own issues at all. 


			but the api will have delay issues. 

intended thing: 
page sends a request -> request received at pending register -> free arduino chosen to complete it->
once done, result is updated and the program sends it back to the requester.  


shared realtime storage X
request queue and responding to the person who requested X
